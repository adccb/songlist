maybe i'll have to walk through the fire
balancing on a razor wire

but i ain't afraid to weep
i ain't afraid to suffer
i ain't afraid to be a fool to be your lover

cuz the silver lining
baby it's blinding
cuz i'm pining, for you
well i don't mind workin, until i'm hurtin
there's nothing i'm certain i wouldn't do

maybe i'll have to work every weekend
to buy you the things you say you're a needin

but i can skip a meal
save up all my money
borrow, beg and steal just to keep you from running
