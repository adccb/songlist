follow me to the harbor, we can sail across the sea
far away from all the things they expect us to be
oh my girl and i
exactly as we are

follow me in the bedroom, we can lay between the sheets
fall asleep at 5 am and warm each others' feet
oh my girl and i
i'm glad she's by my side

it's a long way down
into that deepest blue
i'd still count myself a lucky man
if i'm drowning here with you
oh my girl and i
glad she's by my side

follow me to florida, we can steal a rocket ship
blast off through the moon and stars on a million light-year trip
oh my girl and i
flying through the sky

it's a long way up
into that deepest night
but i'll never be afraid, no
you cast endless light
oh my girl and i
kissing on this flight
