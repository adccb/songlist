it's time to bid this whole world goodbye
oh, glory, time to fly away
we'll meet our savior in the sky
hallelujah, the 21st of may

sinner, heed these words of mine
'bout the coming judgment day
yes, the end is drawing nigh
hallelujah, the 21st of may

they laughed while noah built his boat,
then cried when came the rain
they mock me now, but i will float
on the 21st of may

well, i've never been so sure
and i've never led no one astray
'cept in the fall of '94
but hallelujah, the 21st of may
