i've been staring at this wall going on sixteen days
trying to write these words through a drowsy haze
my friends are knocking on my door, they're calling my name
but i can't seem to go outside today

well i might pour myself another cup of coffee
or maybe put the kettle on for tea
cause life just ain't worth living
if i ain't got my caffeine

i get into work and i try to get going
set down my bag and take a seat
but this office coffee really just ain't working
i don't think i'll do anything today

when i get home my house needs cleaning
but i can't quite seem to find the energy
i lay down on my couch and i just keep on dreaming
cause i can't quite reach to turn on the tv
