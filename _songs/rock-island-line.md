now this here's the story about the rock island line
the rock island line she runs down into new orleans
it's just outside of new orleans is a big toll gate
you know all the trains that go through the toll gate
they gotta pay the man some money
but of course, if you got certain things on board
you're okay and you don't have to pay the man nothin'
and just now we see a change comin down the line
when you come up to the toll gate
the driver, he shout down to the man and he says
i got pigs, i got horses, i got cows
i got sheep, i got all livestock, i got all livestock
i got all livestock

the man say, 'well, you alright boy, just get on through
you don't have to pay me nothin'"
and then the train go through
and when he go through the tollgate
the train gotta have a little bit of steam and a little bit of speed
and when the driver think he safely on the other side
he shouts back down the line to the man and he says
i fooled you, i fooled you
i got pig iron, i got pig iron
i got all pig iron
