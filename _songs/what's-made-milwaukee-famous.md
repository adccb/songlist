it's late and she's waiting
and i know i should go home
but every time i start to leave
they play another song

then someone buys another round
and wherever drinks are free
what's made milwaukee famous
has made a fool out of me

baby's begged me not to go
so many times before
she says love and happiness
can't live behind those swinging doors

now's she's gone and i'm to blame
too late i finally see
what's made milwaukee famous
has made a loser out of me

baby's begged me not to go
so many times before
she says love and happiness
just can't live behind those swinging doors

now's she's gone and i'm to blame
too late i finally see
what's made milwaukee famous
has made a loser out of me
