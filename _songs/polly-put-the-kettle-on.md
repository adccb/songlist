oh little suzy, how i love you
nothing in the world could make me snub you

polly put the kettle on, kettle on, kettle on
polly put the kettle on, boil the tea cause
bread and butter's good enough, good enough for anybody
bread and butter's good enough, good enough for me

tell me baby, what you trying to do
trying to love me and some other man too

tell me baby, what you think
let me go and get myself another drink
