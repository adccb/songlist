i always will remember,
'twas a year ago november,
i went out to hunt some deer
on a morning bright and clear.
i went and shot the maximum the game laws would allow.
two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

i was in no mood to trifle,
i took down my trusty rifle
and went out to stalk my prey.
what a haul i made that day.
i tied them to my fender, and i drove them home somehow,
two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

the law was very firm, it
took away my permit,
the worst punishment i ever endured.
it turned out there was a reason,
cows were out of season,
and one of the hunters wasn't insured.

people ask me how i do it,
and i say, "there's nothin' to it,
you just stand there lookin' cute,
and when something moves, you shoot!"

and there's ten stuffed heads in my trophy room right now,
two game wardens,
seven hunters,
and a pure-bred guernsey cow.
