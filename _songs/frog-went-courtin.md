a frog went a-courtin' and he did ride
sword and pistol by his side

he rode up to miss mousie's door
where he'd often been before

he said, "miss mouse, are you within?"
"yes, i just sat down to spin"

he took miss mouse upon his knee
said "miss mouse, will you marry me?"

"without my uncle rat's consent
i wouldn't marry the president."

then uncle rat rode off to town,
to buy his niece a wedding gown

"oh, where will the wedding supper be?"
"way down yonder in the hollow tree."

the first to come was the little white moth
she spread out the tablecloth
the next to come was the bumblebee
played the fiddle upon his knee

the next to come was a little bitty flea
danced a jig with the bumblebee

the next to come was missus cow
tried to dance but didn't know how

now mister frog was dressed in green
sweet miss mouse looked like a queen

in slowly walked the parson rook
under his arm he carried a book

then frog and mouse went off to france
that's the end of my romance
