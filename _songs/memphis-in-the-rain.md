stand down the blacktop at a cold dark night, boy
pitch black skies there ain't a star in sight
but i'm looking for a change
i'm passing through memphis in the rain

whitewashed buildings and old overgrown yards
i've got one hand on the wheel, i've got one on my heart
looking for a girl without a name
i'm passing through memphis in the rain

but no matter what i do, lord, i can't stop
gotta keep that hammer to the floor baby
until i'm clear out of arkansas mama

'cause i know what they can do to me
lord and i won't let them make a fool out of me
things are starting to get strange
passing through memphis in the rain

sometimes a man's just gotta know when to go
he's gotta earn himself a keepin'
he's gotta know when he's been beat

so i called a cousin down in houston
he said 'come on down boy, we've got work for you to be doing'
i'm looking for a change
passing through memphis in the rain

yeah things are startin' to get strange
i'm passing through memphis in the rain
