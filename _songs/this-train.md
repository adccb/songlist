this train is bound for glory, this train.
this train is bound for glory, this train.
this train is bound for glory,
don't carry nothing but the righteous and the holy.
this train is bound for glory, this train.

this train don't carry no gamblers, this train;
this train don't carry no gamblers, this train;
this train don't carry no gamblers,
liars, thieves, nor big shot ramblers,
this train is bound for glory, this train.

this train don't carry no liars, this train;
this train don't carry no liars, this train;
this train don't carry no liars,
she's streamlined and a midnight flyer,
this train don't carry no liars, this train.

this train don't carry no smokers, this train;
this train don't carry no smokers, this train
this train don't carry no smokers,
two bit liars, small time jokers,
this train don't carry no smokers, this train.

this train don't carry no con men, this train;
this train don't carry no con men, this train;
this train don't carry no con men,
no wheeler dealers, here and gone men,
this train don't carry no con men, this train.

this train don't carry no rustlers, this train;
this train don't carry no rustlers, this train;
this train don't carry no rustlers,
sidestreet walkers, two bit hustlers,
this train is bound for glory, this train.
