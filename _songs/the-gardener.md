i sense a runner in the garden
although my judgements known to fail
once built a steamboat in a meadow
cos i'd forgotten how to sail

i know the runner's going to tell you
there ain't no cowboy in my hair
so now he's buried by the daisies
so i could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe

i sense a spy up in the chimney
from all the evidence i've burned
i guess he'll read it in the smoke now
and soon to ashes i'll return

i know the spy is going to tell you
it's not my flag up in the pole
so now he's buried by the lilies
so i could stay forever more in your eyes, babe

i sense a leak inside my phone now
from all the lies i have told
i know he has your private number
and soon he'll make that vicious call

i know the leak is going to tell you
there ain't no puppy in your leash
so now he'll fertilize the roses
so i could stay the king you see
in your eyes, babe
in your eyes, babe

so now we're dancing through the garden
and what a garden i have made
and now that death will grow my jasmine
i find it soothing i'm afraid

now there is no need for suspicion
there ain't no frog kissing your hand
i won't be lying when i tell you
that i'm a garner i'm a man

in your eyes babe
in your eyes, babe
in your eyes, babe
