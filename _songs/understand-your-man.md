don't call my name out your window, i'm leavin'
i won't even turn my head.
don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
i'll be gone, like i said.

you'd just say the same old thing
that you be sayin' all along,
just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till i'm gone.
don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan

understand your man, i'm tired of your bad-mouthin'
understand your man.

you can give my other suit to the salvation army,
and everything else i leave behind
i ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
while i'm untanglin' my mind.

i ain't gonna repeat
what i said any more
while i'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before,
i'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter

then you'll understand your man, meditate on it
understand your man, you hear me talking
understand your man. remember what i told you
understand your man
understand your man
