the weak spot on a beachball is the valve
if you don't count the smell
or the fact that the harder you hit it

the slower it seems to go
till the wind blows and takes it away
to the side of the bay

where the guard at the gate
has a gun and a phone and a radio

you say the world isn't fair
you say you don't care
you say it was cheap and you tell me
the damn thing never did hold air, hold air
as we watch it float toward
the boats over there

where the guard at the gate
has a gun and a phone and a radio
