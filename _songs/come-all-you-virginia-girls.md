oh come all you virginia girls and listen to my noise
don’t you court no west virginia boys
if you do your fortune’ll be
johnny cake and venison and sassafras tea
johnny cake and venison and sassafras tea

well, when they come a courtin’ i’ll tell you what they’ll wear
old black suit just about to tear
old straw hat more brim than crown
a pair of woolen socks they wear the whole year round
a pair of woolen socks they wear the whole year round

and when they come a courtin’ i’ll tell you what they’ll say
first they’ll say, has your daddy shot a bear?
then they’ll say as they sit down,
honey can you bake your johnny cake brown
honey can you bake your johnny cake brown

oh come all you virginia girls and listen to my noise
don’t you court no west virginia boys
if you do your fortune’ll be
johnny cake and venison and sassafras tea
johnny cake and venison and sassafras tea
