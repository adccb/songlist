now what do you do when you're lonesome?
where do you go when you're blue?
and how do you deal with such emotion?
when you're just an ordinary fool?

do you hang your head and walk the streets hoping no one sees your face?
wishing you were someone else someplace far away?
do you stay out late nights drinking trying to smile through?
a pain that everybody knows is tearing you in two?

now what do you do when you're lonesome?
where do you go when you're blue?
and how do you deal with such emotion?
when you're just an ordinary fool?

now some have tried changes of geography and such
others have locked their hearts away for fear that they'll fall in love
oh, but still there's still some far too dumb to know there's something wrong
and they waste their lives wondering why they're waking up alone

now what do you do when you're lonesome?
where do you go when you're blue?
and how do you deal with such emotion?
when you're just an ordinary fool?

now what do you do when you're lonesome?
where do you go when you're blue?
and how do you deal with such emotion?
when you're just an ordinary fool?
