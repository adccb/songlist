corrine corrina, where you've been so long
corrine corrina, where you've been so long
ain't had no loving since you've been gone

corrine, corrina where'd you stay last night
corrine, corrina where'd you stay last night
come home this morning the sun was shining bright

i left corrina way across the sea
i left corrina way across the sea
she wouldn't write me no letters,
she wouldn't talk to me

i love corrina, tell the world i do
i love corrina, tell the world i do
and i pray each night that she loves me too
