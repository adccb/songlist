i love my friends
and they love me
we're just as close
as we can be
and just because
we really care
whatever we get
we share!

i got it from agnes
she got it from jim
we all agree it must have been louise who gave it to him
now, she got if from harry, who got it from marie
and everybody knows that marie got it from me!

giles got it from daphne, she got it from joan
who picked it up in county cork, a-kissin' the blarney stone
pierre gave it to sheila, who must have brought it there
he got it from franvois and jacques, aha! lucky pierre!

max got it from edith
who gets it every spring
she got it from her daddy, who just gives her everything
she then gave it to daniel, whose spaniel has it now
our dentist even got it, and we're still wondering how!

but i got it from agnes
or maybe it was sue
or millie or billie or gillie or willie, it doesn't matter who
it might have been at the pub, or at the club, or in the loo

and if you'll be my friend, then i might, mind you, i said "might"
give it to you!
