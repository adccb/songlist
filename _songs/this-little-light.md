this little light of mine
i’m gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
i’m gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
i’m gonna let it shine
let it shine, let it shine
let it shine

monday gave me the gift of love
tuesday peace came from above
wednesday told me to have more faith
thursday gave me a little more grace
friday told me to watch and pray
saturday told me just what to say
sunday gave me the power devine
for to let my little light shine

light that shines is the light of love
lights the darkness from above
shines on me and it shines on you
shows you what the power of love can do
shine my light both far and near
shine my light both bright and clear
on every dark corner that i find
gonna let my little light shine

this little light
shines all night
star light, star bright
first one tonight
little light of mine
gonna shine, shine, shine, shine
every day, every day, every day, every way
gonna let my little light shine
every day, every day, every day, every way
gonna let my little light shine
