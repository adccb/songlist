was in the spring
not in the fall
spent all our money
on alcohol

and now she's gone
and i dont' worry
lord, i'm sitting
on top of the world

she called me up
from down in al paso
she said "come back, daddy
ooh, i need you so"

if you don't like my peaches
don't you shake my tree
'n get out of my orchard
let my peaches be

and don't you come here runnin'
holding out your hand
i'm gonna get me a woman
like you got your man

't was in the spring
one sunny day
my sweetheart left me
lord, she went away
