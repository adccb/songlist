the cool of the day
the blues fly away
as i look over and see

you next to me
under the tree
on a warm summer’s day

and i feel i could do anything
with you by my side
we may not have much, but we have everything 
for the rest of our lives

so come what may and come what might
i know we’ll get us through the night, cause
when i saw you i saw the light
