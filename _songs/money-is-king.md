if a man has money today
people don't care if he has kokobe
if a man has money today
people don't care if he has kokobe
he can commit murder and get off free
live in the governorâ€™s company
but if you are poor people tell you "shoo!
a dog is better than you"

a man with money walks into the store
the boss must shake his hand at the door
call ten lads to take down anything
whisky, cloth, earring, and diamond ring
send it to your home on a motor bike
you can pay the bill whenever you'd like
and not a soul will ask you a thing
they know very well that money is king

so if a man has money today
people don't care if he has kokobe
if a man has money today
people don't care if he has kokobe
he can commit murder and get off free
rise to the seat of the presidency
but if you are poor, people tell you "shoo!
a dog is better than you"
