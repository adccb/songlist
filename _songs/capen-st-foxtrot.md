like i said, you gotta live in between
the sky, the ground, the sea, the things that crawl
the world around us has more songs to sing
but you've been on my mind

like i said, you gotta be self-assured
sing along with the choir
i been trying to stay on key
but you've been on my mind

when i get sad, i look overhead
and watch the clouds rolling by
when i'm glad and there's a song in my head
i pick up my guitar and write

like i said, you gotta live in between
the sky, the ground, the sea, the things that crawl
the world around us has more songs to sing
but you've been on my mind
