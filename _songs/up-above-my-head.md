up above my head
there's music in the air
up above my head
there's music everywhere
up above my head
there's music in the air
and i really do believe
there's joy somewhere

and in my home
there's music everywhere
oh, in my home
there's music in the air
in my home
there's music in the air
and i really do believe
there's joy somewhere

in my soul
there's music everywhere
in my soul
it makes me whole
in my soul
there's music everywhere
and i really do believe
there's joy somewhere
