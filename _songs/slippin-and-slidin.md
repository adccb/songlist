i shoulda learned better
old enough to know
i'm slipping and slidin', feelin' low

yeah just sit back in bed
ashamed for sure, baby
slipping and sliding, feeling low

now i'm waking up feeling bad, babe
i'm losing patience with my only friends

why do i try my luck?
i should never touch the stuff
but it shouldn't make any difference, ma
as long as i keep up appearances, lord

i've been working too hard
i need some coming home, baby
slipping and sliding, and feeling low

darling i just need a little company
ain't seen the sunrise since i don't know when, baby

days getting longer, nights getting cold
slipping and sliding and feeling low

well i'm a slipping and sliding, peeking and hiding
slipping and sliding, feeling low
