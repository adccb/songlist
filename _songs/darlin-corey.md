wake up, wake up darlin cory
tell me what makes you sleep so sound
the revenue officers are comin
gonna tear your still house down

dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
dig a hole in the cold, cold ground
dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
gonna lay darlin cory down

oh the first time i saw darlin cory
she was standin in the door
she had her shoes and her stockings in her hand
and her little bare feet on the floor

oh the next time i saw darlin cory
she was standin by the banks of the sea
she had a 44 strapped around her body
and a banjo on her knee

oh the last time i saw darlin cory
she had a wine glass in her hand
she was drinkin that sweet liquor
with a low down gamblin man.
