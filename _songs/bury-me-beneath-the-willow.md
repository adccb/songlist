tonight i'm sad, my heart is lonesome
for the only one i love
when shall i see her? oh no, never
till we meet in heaven above

so bury me beneath the willow
under the weepin' willow tree
so she will know where i am sleepin'
and perhaps she'll weep for me

she told me that she dearly loved me
how could i believe it untrue?
until an angel softly whispered
she could never care for you

so bury me beneath the willow
under the weepin' willow tree
so she will know where i am sleepin'
and perhaps she'll weep for me

tomorrow was to be our wedding
oh god, oh god, where can she be?
she's gone a-courtin' with another
and no longer cares for me
