i saw a man, he's a well-dressed man
he had a tan from the yucatan
he had a car, he looked like a star
i said, hey, don't i know who you are
but when he glanced into my eyes
i saw yes i saw was such a big surprise

he was afraid that he's just a bum
someday when all his stuff is gone and he's left without a dime
time ain't money when all ya got is time
and you can see him standin on the corner with a nine-day beard and bright red eyes

i know a guy, he's a pal of mine
i say, hey. he say, i'm doin fine
i'm movin up the ladder, rung rung rung
i'm gonna get my million while i am still young
but at night when he's had a few

his eyes say different than his tongue, they say i'm afraid that i'm just a bum
someday when all my stuff is gone and i'm left without a dime
time ain't money when all ya got is time
and i can see me standin on the corner with my nine-day beard and my bright red eyes
goin hey, hey hey hey hey, come on and listen to my story, hey, hey hey hey hey, ah hey

some people live to work, work to live
any little tremble and the earth might give
ya can't hide it in a volvo or a london fog
can't hide it in a mansion with an imported dog

no matter how we plan and rehearse, we're at pink slip's mercy in a paper universe
and we're afraid that we're just a bum
someday when all our stuff is gone and we're left without a dime
time ain't money when all ya got is time
and we can see us standin on the corner with our nine-day beards and our bright red eyes
goin, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey, come on and listen to my story man hey, hey hey hey hey, ah hey

the man of sorrow's acquainted with grief
stands in line waiting for relief
he will tell ya it wasn't always this way
one bad little thing happened one bad little day

heartbreak has bad teeth and a sour smell and lives when he can in a cheap hotel
and he's afraid that he's just a bum
someday when all his stuff is gone and he's left without a dime
time ain't money when all ya got is time
and you can see him standin on the corner with a nine-day beard and bright red eyes
goin, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey, come on and listen to my story man hey, hey hey hey hey, ah hey
