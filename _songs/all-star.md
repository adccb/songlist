somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
i ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
in the shape of an "l" on her forehead

well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

so much to do, so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
you'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow

hey now, you're an all star
get your game on, go play
hey now, you're a rock star
get the show on, get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold

it's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
you're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
but the meteor men beg to differ
judging by the hole in the satellite picture

the ice we skate is getting pretty thin
the water's getting warm so you might as well swim
my world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
that's the way i like it and i'll never get bored

somebody once asked
could i spare some change for gas?
"i need to get myself away from this place"
i said, "yep, what a concept
i could use a little fuel myself
and we could all use a little change"

well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
fed to the rules and i hit the ground running
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

so much to do, so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
you'll never know if you don't go (go!)
you'll never shine if you don't glow
