i've never seen a diamond in the flesh
i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
and i'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
no post code envy

but every song is like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
we don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

but everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

and we'll never be royals
it don't run in our blood
that kind of lux just ain't for us
we crave a different kind of buzz

let me be your ruler, you can call me queen b
and baby i'll rule
let me live that fantasy

my friends and i we've cracked the code
we count our dollars on the train to the party
and everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
we didn't come from money
