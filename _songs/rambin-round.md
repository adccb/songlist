ramblin' around your city
ramblin' around your town
i never see a friend i know
as i go ramblin' 'round, boys
as i go ramblin' 'round

my sweetheart and my parents
i left in my old hometown
i'm out to do the best i can
as i go ramblin' round, boys
as i go ramblin' round

the peach trees they are loaded
the limbs are bending down
i pick 'em all day for a dollar, boys
as i go a ramblin' 'round, boys
as i go a ramblin' 'round

sometimes the fruit gets rotten
and falls upon the ground
there's a hungry mouth for every peach
as i go a ramblin' 'round, boys
as i go a ramblin' 'round

i wish that i could marry
i wish that i could settle down
but i cant' save a penny, boys
as i go a ramblin' 'round
as i go a ramblin' 'round

my mother prayed that i would be
a man of some renown
but i'm just a refugee
as i go a ramblin' 'round, boys
as i go a ramblin' 'round
