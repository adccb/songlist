name ten things you wanna do before you die and then go do them
name ten places you really wanna be before you die and then go to them

name ten books you wanna read before you die and then go read them
name ten songs you wanna hear again before you die, get all of your friends together and scream them

because right now all you have is time time time yeah,
but someday that time will run out
that's the only thing you can be absolutely certain about

think of all the things that are wrong with your life and then fix them
think of all the things that you love about your life, be thankful you are blessed with them

think of all the things that hold you back and realize that you don't need them
think of all the mistakes you have made in your life, make sure that you never repeat them

name ten thousand reasons why you never wanna die, go and tell someone who might've forgotten

try to list the endless reasons why it's good to be alive, and then just smile for awhile about them

soon the sun will rise and another day will come
soon enough the sun will set, another day will be gone
