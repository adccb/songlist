don't need no cup of coffee in the morning, i can get up fine
delia is a pretty girl but she ain't mine
take a little trip to the station, i'm bound to go
when i'll see my lover again, i do not know

too long, too long
i've been gone

four white walls and a worried mind, that's all i have, that's all
and when i need someone to talk to, i just say hello walls

four winds blow the breeze, wipe my tears away, they say you're fine
when the world seems so far away, i've got nothing left except my mind
