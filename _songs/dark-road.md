a dark road is a hard road to travel
a light road is always best
a dark road will lead you to trouble
while a light road will lead you to rest

don’t this road look dark and lonesome
don’t the way look awful rough
but if you keep the light to guide you
you’ll find that it’s always enough

so, don’t you ever be downhearted
where there’s a will there’s a way
tomorrow the may be shining
although it is cloudy today

the dark road is a hard road to travel
the light road is always best
the dark road will take to you trouble
while the light road will lead you to rest
