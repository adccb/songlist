the last time i was depressed
i spent seven days in bed
all alone with my cell phone off
just as i was starting to get ahead

the last time i saw my friend
i really thought i was on the mend
but when i got home i turned my cell phone off
and sadly crawled between the sheets back into bed

i can see the sunrise
through the closed window by my bed
i can see the sunset
behind the tops of all the buildings, and another day is coming to an end

i can see the headlights
and all the lights of the city winking out
i can see the moon rise
casting smooth white light upon my face as i drift away to sleep
