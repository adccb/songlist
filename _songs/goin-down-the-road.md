going down the road feeling bad
going down the road feeling bad
going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
don't wanna be treated this a way

going where the climate suits my clothes
i'm going where the climate suits my clothes
going where the climate suits my clothes
don't wanna be treated this a way

going where the water tastes like wine
well i'm going where the water tastes like wine
going where the water tastes like wine
i don't wanna be treated this a way
