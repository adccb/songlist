this land is your land, this land is my land
from the california to the new york island
from the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me

as i went walking that ribbon of highway
i saw above me that endless skyway
and saw below me that golden valley
this land was made for you and me

i roamed and rambled and i followed my footsteps
to the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
and all around me , a voice was sounding
this land was made for you and me

when the sun comes shining, then i was strolling
in the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
the voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
this land was made for you and me

this land is your land and this land is my land
from the california to the new york island
from the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me

when the sun comes shining, then i was strolling
in wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
the voice come chanting as the fog was lifting
this land was made for you and me
