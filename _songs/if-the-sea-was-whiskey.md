if the sea was whiskey and i was a diving duck
if the sea was whiskey and i was a diving duck
i'd swim to the bottom and i don't know if i'd come up

i'm just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
i'm just here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
if things don't get no better then down the road i go

whiskey and beers they don't make me drunk
whiskey and beers they don't make me druink
these blues are gonna make me pack my trunk
