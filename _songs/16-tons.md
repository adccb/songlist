some people say a man is made outta mud
a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
muscle and blood and skin and bones
a mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

you load 16 tons, what do you get?
another day older and deeper in debt
st. peter don't you call me, 'cause i can't go
i owe my soul to the company store

i was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
i picked up my shovel and i walked to the mine
i loaded 16 tons of number nine coal
and the straw boss said, "well, a-bless my soul"

i was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
fightin' and trouble are my middle name
i was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
can't no high toned woman make me walk the line

if you see me comin', better step aside
a lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
one fist of iron, the other of steel
if the right one don't get you
then the left one will
