headed down south to the land of the pines
and i'm thumbin' my way into north caroline
starin' up the road
pray to god i see headlights

i made it down the coast in seventeen hours
pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
and i'm a hopin' for raleigh
i can see my baby tonight

so rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama anyway you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south-bound train
hey mama rock me

runnin' from the cold up in new england
i was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
my baby plays the guitar
i pick a banjo now

oh, the north country winters keep a gettin' me now
lost my money playin' poker so i had to up and leave
but i ain't a turnin' back
to livin' that old life no more

walkin' to the south out of roanoke
i caught a trucker out of philly
had a nice long toke
but he's a headed west from the cumberland gap
to johnson city, tennessee

and i gotta get a move on before the sun
i hear my baby callin' my name
and i know that she's the only one
and if i die in raleigh
at least i will die free
