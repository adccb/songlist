i know that you've heard
this old song sung before,
but you ain't heard it
while i was walking out the door

it's goodbye baby,
honey your time has come,
i've turned the tables
and now you're the one on the bum

it's la la la,
i'm singing la la la
i'm so happy i'm singing la la la

if i was a catfish
in the river down in st. louie,
i'd be the biggest fish, honey
anyone had ever seen

you know i'd never get caught
cause i never bite the hook and line,
all the women try and catch me
as i go swimming by

honey, i'm short and thin
so i can squeeze out of any position
you put me in

i've got this old thing
called the laughing hearts disease,
i'm gonna laugh my way to
any old place i please
