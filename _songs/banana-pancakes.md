can't you see that it's just rainin'
ain't no need to go outside

but baby
you hardly even notice
when i try to show you 
this song is meant to keep you
from doin' what you're supposed to

wakin' up too early
maybe we could sleep in
make you banana pancakes
pretend like its the weekend now

we could pretend it all the time
can't you see that it's just rainin'
there ain't no need to go outside

just maybe
halaka ukulele mama made a baby
really don't mind the practice
cause you're my little lady
lady lady love me
cause i love to lay here lazy
we could close the curtains
pretend like there's no world outside


ain't no need ain't no need
can't you see can't you see
rain all day and i don't mind

but the telephone's singing ringing
it's too early don't pick it up

we don't need to
we got everything we need right here
and everything we need is enough

just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
wake up slow
mmm wake up slow

there ain't no need to go outside
ain't no need, ain't no need
rain all day and i really really really don't mind
can't you see? can't you see?
we gotta wake up slow
