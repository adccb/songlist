it's winter outside my door
the snow is thick, the windows covered in hoar
gonna light a fire and try to stay warm

the wind's cold and fast and shrill as it
tears through the cracks in the window sill
if i can't get warm, this storm's gonna kill me

i don't mind the hopeless cold, but this storm happened at night
the wind got into the cracks in my mind and extinguished all of my light
so here i sit, alone, alive, and haunted by the things that live inside my mind
i don't know how i can make this come out right
