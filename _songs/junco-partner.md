down the road came a junco partner
for he was loaded as can be
he was knocked out, knocked out loaded
he was a'wobblin' all over the street

singing six months ain't no sentence
and one year ain't no time
i was born in angola
serving fourteen to ninety nine

give me water when i'm thirsty
give me whisky when i dry
i want my lover when i'm alone
i'm gonna go get him fore i die

well i wish i had me a million dollars
oh one million to call my own
i would raise meat and say, "grow for me baby"
i would raise me a tobacco farm

well i wish i would have me a great deal of money
yeah and mighty good things all over town
now i ain't got no more money
all of my good friends are putting me down

so now i gotta pawn my rifle and pistol
yeah i'm gonna pawn my watch and chain
i would have pawned my seat gabriella
but the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name
give me headstone when i die
