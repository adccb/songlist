the missouri is my right arm, the ohio is my left
but i'm livin' on the mississippi river where i like life the best
i don't mind the west coast, and i don't mind the east coast
oh, baby but i ain't gonna live on no coast

i'm just a plain ole midwestern boy
gettin' by on central time

some people say that the mississippi river is the backbone of the nation
they can say whatever they want, i won't disagree with that statement
i see people workin' hard as ever, just wondering what i can do to make their lives better

well, i won't worry if the world don't like me, i won't let 'em waste my time
'cause there ain't nothin' goin' to change my mind, i'm feelin' fine
gettin' by on central time
