took two hours to wake up today
took two hours to wake up today
took a half an hour to get into the shower
the shower took an hour

the hard work helps the time go by
hard work helps the time go by

let a song on the radio make me cry
some girl i dont even know drive me crazy
let a song on the radio make me cry
some girl i dont even know drive me crazy

but hard work helps the time go by
hard work helps the time go by

took two hours just to fall asleep
took two long hours to get to sleep
got a couple good hours before the bad dreams
the bad dreams dont let me get any sleep
