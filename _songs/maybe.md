the first guy i know who died
i can't remember his name
the tenth grade started, he just never came again
all his friends sat around and cried for a day or two

you can say what you want about immortal soul
when that guy died it left a hole
it was my first clue
that when they're gone they're gone

maybe jesus beat that rap
we're not sure
maybe you can live forever
if your heart is pure
or maybe you'll come back
some day as a king prawn
maybe angels come
and take you away to heaven
or the other way
but from down here it appears
that when they're gone, they're gone

me and stevie gibson used to walk home from school
he used to have this little turn around rule
if you turn around the one way gotta turn around
the other way or it's bad luck

he went out rafting on the river
the river went around and the raft went around
and his luck got all wound up and he drowned
and he was gone

two weeks after dieter died you could call him on the phone
and he would tell you that he's not home
and it gave you an eerie feeling even though you knew
it was just an answering machine

'cause somewhere deep inside you know
that they don't come back when they go
and he had gone
and when they're gone, they're gone

my mother died in intensive care
we were sitting around singing on folding chairs
when i got the feeling somebody wasn't there

well i counted noses but it came out right
the doctors said she died that night
but i felt that hole and i knew that she had gone

i looked up death in the dictionary one day
just to see what the dictionary had to say
it's the complete and irreversible cessation of life functions

which is not very poetic but it's precise and clean
and if you analyze it what that means is
when they're gone, they're gone
