you don't have to be a scientist
to do experiments
on your own heart

i had no place to put myself
but i had lots of time
so i threw out some past
and made room for more future

now i'm standing on the scene
between my memories and dreams
balanced on the scene
between my memories and dreams
floating down the stream
between my memories and dreams
and i see a better person
waiting his turn to be me

now i'm running down the runway
in between gigantic numbers
i'm running down the runway
in between gigantic numbers
i'm running down the runway
in between gigantic numbers
with my knapsack
and a zero for a halo

my halo's got a hole in it
so it don't keep me dry
but it's ok 'cause
my brain is my heart's umbrella

i had a girl i had to leave
but i saw her face upon my sleeve
it kept talking
so i put it in the laundry

and as it spun and spun
it tried to ask me what i'd done
but i was gone
on down the road out to the lane
