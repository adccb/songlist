from the great atlantic ocean to the wide pacific shore
she climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
she's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
she's a regular combination on the wabash cannonball

listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
as she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
traveling through the jungle on the wabash cannonball

well she came down from birmingham one cold december day
as she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
she's from tennessee she's long and she's tall
she came down from birmingham on the wabash cannonball

here's to daddy claxton may his name forever stand
and always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
his earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
we'll carry him home to dixie on the wabash cannonball

listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
as she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
traveling through the jungle on the wabash cannonball
