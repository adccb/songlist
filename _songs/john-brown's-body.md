john brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave
john brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave
john brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave
but his soul goes marching on

the stars above in heaven are looking kindly down
the stars above in heaven are looking kindly down
the stars above in heaven are looking kindly down
on the grave of old john brown

glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah
glory, glory, hallelujah
his soul goes marching on

he captured harper's ferry with his nineteen men so true
he frightened old virginia till she trembled through and through
they hung him for a traitor, they themselves the traitor crew
but his soul goes marching on
