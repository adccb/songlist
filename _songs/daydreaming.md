the distance between us
is fucking with my head
i'm looking high into the midnight sky
when i should be there instead

and lately it's been harder
to get me out of bed
we're just text on a screen
when i should kiss you instead 

so let's get high
and sit outside and watch the moon rise
but that's in my mind
i'm drifting off and daydreaming, with you inside my head
