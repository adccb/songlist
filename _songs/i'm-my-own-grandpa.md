now, many many years ago
when i was twenty three
i was married to a widow
who was pretty as could be
this widow had a grown-up daughter
had hair of red
my father fell in love with her
and soon the two were wed

this made my dad my son-in-law
and changed my very life
my daughter was my mother
'cause she was my father's wife
to complicate the matters
even though it brought me joy
i soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy

my little baby then became
a brother-in-law to dad
and so became my uncle
though it made me very sad
for if he was my uncle
that also made him the brother
of the widow's grown-up daughter
who, of course, was my step-mother

my father's wife then had a son
that kept them on the run
and he became my grandchild
for he was my daughter's son
my wife is now my mother's mother
and it makes me blue
because, she is my wife
she's my grandmother too

now, if my wife is my grandmother
then, i am her grandchild
and every time i think of it
it nearly drives me wild
for now i have become
the strangest case you ever saw
as husband of my grandmother
i am my own grandpa

i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
it sounds funny i know
but it really is so
i'm my own grandpa
