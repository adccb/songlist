well, you can tell the world about this
you can tell the nation about that
tell 'em what the master has done
tell 'em that the gospel has come
tell 'em that the victory's been won
he brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
into my heart

well, my lord spoke, he spoke so well
yes, he did, yes, he did
talked about the flames that burn in hell
yes, he did, yes, he did
now my lord spoke, he spoke so well
yes, he did, yes, he did
talked about the children of israel
yes, he did, yes, he did

well, my lord spoke, he spoke to me
yes, he did, yes, he did
talkin' 'bout a man from galilee
yes, he did, yes, he did
my lord spoke, he spoke to me
yes, he did, yes, he did
talkin' 'bout a man from galilee
yes, he did, yes, he did

well, i don't know but i've been told
yes, he did, yes, he did
streets of heaven are paved with gold
yes, he did, yes, he did

yes, he did, yes, he did
i got a home on the other side
yes, he did, yes, he did
