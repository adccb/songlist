the past few weeks i've been lying to myself
thinking i was getting by
but now it's clear i'm just punishing myself

i've been wasting my life going through the motions
when all i want to do is die
medicating with tonics and potions

but i'm not in any shape
to face it all, so i'll have 
one more beer and one more bowl and one more for the road
i'll have one more beer and one more bowl and one more for the road
